Regarding formating:
I reformated/refactored all .py files to follow the latest PEP standards. I have no strong preference towards the PEP standard, but it is what comes built in pyCharm.
If you have any other formating standards I'd be open to take a look, but as of now I adopted this one so pyCharm doesn't flood my screen with formating warnings.

Suggestions:
# There seems to be some common files (like library.py) that share functionalities in both the discrete and continuous algorithms. Maybe it is clever to make a package for these common functionalities or use relative importing to make sure these files don't get desynced.
# We have a lot of functions and classes doing a myriad of tasks that are not always immediatelly obvious to the reader. Perhaps we should adopt the docstring standard for function and class documentation?
